# Use INSERTION SORT when you have a small number of elements to sort or the elements in the initial collection are already “nearly sorted.” Determining when the array is “small enough” varies from one machine to another and by program- ming language. Indeed, even the type of element being compared may be significant.

def insert(data, pos, value)

end

data = [15, 9, 8, 1, 4, 11, 7, 12, 13, 6, 5, 3, 16, 2, 10, 14]
